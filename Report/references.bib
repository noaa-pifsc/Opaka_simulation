	abstract = {Growth characteristics of Pristipomoides filamentosus, a deepwater eteline snapper of major economic importance, are incomplete and inconsistent across its geographical range. Early growth rates have been validated using daily increment and length–frequency analyses, but historical estimates of adult growth rates are variable and longevity is unknown. Studies of P. filamentosus in the Hawaiian Islands have cautioned against unjustified estimates of longevity, but 18 years has at times been uncritically assumed as the maximum age. The present study addresses these age, growth, and longevity issues using lead–radium and bomb radiocarbon dating by providing valid age estimates for adult P. filamentosus. Valid length-at-age estimates ranged from approximately 10 years to more than 40 years. These data, together with robust daily increment data, were used to model a fully validated, long-lived life history for P. filamentosus. This study adds to the few existing studies supporting a view that many tropical fishes, particularly deepwater species, can be longer lived than previously surmised.},

	abstract = {The crimson jobfish Pristipomoides filamentosus (locally known as ‘opakapaka’ in Hawaii) is a deep-water eteline lutjanid that supports important commercial and recreational fisheries in Hawaii and throughout much of the Indo-Pacific region. It is one of the most commonly caught species of the ‘Deep-7’ bottomfish species complex in the commercial bottomfish fishery of Hawaii. However, there are currently no validated estimates of median body sizes at sexual maturity that can be used in a comprehensive evaluation of the species’ stock status within Hawaiian bottomfish fisheries. Herein we provide size-at-maturity estimates for the species in the main Hawaiian Islands: median length at maturity of 40.7-cm fork length (FL; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 40.3–41.2cm) for females and 34.3cm FL (95\% CI 33.3–35.3cm) for males, with respective equivalent median weight-at-maturity estimates of {\textasciitilde}1.17 and {\textasciitilde}0.70kg (2.58 and 1.55 lb). We suggest these newly available data be seriously considered in any future evaluations of minimum size regulations, currently set at {\textasciitilde}0.45kg (1 lb) regardless of sex, for the species’ fisheries in Hawaii.},

	abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},
